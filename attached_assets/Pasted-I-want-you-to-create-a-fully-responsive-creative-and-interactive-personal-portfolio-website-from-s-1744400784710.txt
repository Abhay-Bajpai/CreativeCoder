I want you to create a fully responsive, creative, and interactive personal portfolio website from scratch that showcases my work, skills, and contact information. The design should be modern, sleek, professional, and make use of smooth animations and micro-interactions to create a delightful user experience. The entire site should be production-ready and deployable on platforms like Vercel or Netlify.

🔧 Tech Stack (Frontend)
Use the following technologies to build the frontend:

Vite for fast bundling and development

React as the JavaScript framework

Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

Framer Motion for smooth entrance and scroll animations

Lucide Icons or HeroIcons for minimal SVG icons

React Hook Form + Zod for contact form validation

Three.js or CSS 3D for animated 3D Skills cube (optional but encouraged)

Dark/Light Mode Toggle with transitions (using Tailwind's darkMode: 'class')
